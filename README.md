# Actuarial Analysis and Predictive Modeling
ActuarIA SOFTWARE Life insurance functionality

*Project Overview :* 
This project aims to provide an in-depth analysis and application of actuarial formulas, integrating machine learning techniques to enhance predictive accuracy and decision-making. This notebook includes theoretical explorations, data processing, and model implementation to provide actionable insights. Designed for data scientists and actuarial professionals, the project bridges traditional actuarial concepts with modern machine learning tools.

*Project Structure :*
Actuarial Formulas: Detailed explanation and implementation of core actuarial formulas.
Data Processing: Using Python libraries (Pandas, Numpy) to clean, preprocess, and structure data for analysis.
Visualization: Exploratory data analysis with matplotlib and seaborn to interpret trends and distributions.
Modeling: Includes machine learning models, such as linear regression, with an aim to predict key actuarial metrics.
